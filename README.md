# WaffeInTheBox
A patch for COTD that adds the Wunderwaffe back into the box.

## Changes
- Added the Wunderwaffe to the box, you can pack a punch the ones from the box.
- To prevent George from taking your box Wunderwaffe, he will drop the opposite variation of the one that you currently have.
- The Wunderwaffe from the box is slightly weighted.
